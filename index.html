        Plot
        A mysterious sniper is contacted by an aged secret agent, V. K. Naidu, based in New Delhi, to kill a target, Farid Haqqani, from a distance. However, the sniper instead shoots Naidu and escapes. He is revealed to be former RAW agent Kabir Dhaliwal, considered one of the agency's best who has now gone rogue.
        
        Shortly after, Kabir's former boss and RAW joint secretary, Col. Sunil Luthra, relays Kabir's betrayal to Defence Minister Sherna Patel, who calls for the agency to summon Khalid Rahmani, another RAW agent who was previously mentored by Kabir and is in full awe of the former mentor. Khalid is now assigned to eliminate Kabir and accepts the mission. A flashback shows Khalid's introduction to Kabir, who questions Sunil about Khalid's loyalty to the nation arguing that Khalid's father was a traitor to both the nation and to Kabir himself when he shot him. Khalid, who regards Kabir as his major inspiration, insists that he will serve his country, no matter what, and regain his family's honour.<br>
        
        After a successful mission in Tikrit, Iraq, Kabir takes Khalid to account after noticing that he has a blind spot in his right peripheral vision while aiming a weapon. Khalid explains that his father's reputation led to him being injured in the right eye by school bullies. Kabir, however accepts Khalid after seeing the love he expresses for his mother Nafeesa, his country and for seeing how he has proven his worth. Kabir inducts Khalid into his special forces team which consists of fellow field agents Saurabh, Prateek, Muthu and Aditi. Kabir plans his next mission which is targeted at criminal mastermind and terrorist- businessman, Rizwan Illiyasi. The team capture Illiyasi, but he reveals to Kabir that there is a mole in his team who is fully loyal to his terrorist cause. Killing Prateek and Muthu, Saurabh reveals himself as the mole; blinded by greed, he had accepted Illiyasi's offer of nearly $100 million to betray his country. An enraged Khalid chases after Saurabh, leaving Kabir to deal with Illiyasi alone. Kabir, who nearly succeeds in recapturing Illiyasi, is shot unconscious by Illiyasi's men. He wakes up in hospital a week later to find a severely injured Khalid, also recovering, who tells Kabir that he has killed Saurabh.<br>
        
        In the present, Khalid is nearly taken off the mission when an army officer, Lt Col. Jimmy Shroff, is murdered by Kabir. Khalid manages to find Kabir and learns that his next target is Dr. Utpal Biswas. Kabir is seen doting on a young girl named Ruhi. He remembers about her single mother, Naina Verma, with whom he had started his relationship with in order to make her a civilian asset. A flashback shows how Kabir started his relationship with Naina. Later, on learning the truth, she becomes mistrustful and hesitant to help Kabir but agrees for her daughter's sake. She is sent to spy on Illiyasi's associate, Firoze Contractor. Kabir, who has been in touch with Aditi, learns from her that among Illiyasi's many contacts is a plastic surgeon, Dr. Mallika Singhal. Realising that Firoze is actually Illiyasi, Kabir rushes to Naina's aid but is too late to save her life.<br>
        
        In the present, Khalid is unable to prevent Biswas from being killed by Kabir. Infuriated, he gives chase to Kabir who escapes again. After Khalid tries to convince Sunil to give him one final chance, he is fired.<br>
        
        Khalid traces Kabir through Ruhi and finds out that Kabir is actually targeting associates of Illiyasi, referred to as "Rook" (Naidu), "Knight" (Shroff) "Bishop" (Biswas) and an unknown "Pawn", and is on an undercover mission to recover a drive with a secret code that Illiyasi needs. Meanwhile at Kabir's hideout, both of them are attacked. They fight off the attackers and make it to Aditi's wedding in Kerala, whereupon they recover the drive with the secret code that Illiyasi needs. However, after Kabir hands over the drive to him, Khalid poisons him with TTX while sharing a drink with Kabir on his boat.
        
        <br>A flashback to the chase between Khalid and Saurabh reveals Khalid being shot dead by Illiyasi, following which Saurabh undergoes plastic surgery to disguise himself as Khalid, just like how Illiyasi had transformed into Contractor. On the boat, Saurabh reveals himself as the "Pawn" as he throws a poisoned and helpless Kabir into the river.
        
        <br> Saurabh returns to Illiyasi, who bases himself on a heavily armed icebreaker ship. Kabir, who was assumed dead by Saurabh, parachutes aboard, single-handedly assaults the ship and eliminates Illiyasi's army. He then confronts Saurabh, revealing that he had known that the latter was not Khalid, having seen him aim and shoot perfectly with his right side in a way which Khalid couldn't due to his impaired vision, and also for his choice to drink alcohol, which was considered forbidden by Khalid due to religious beliefs. Hence, he had also acquired the antidote for the poison in his drink and put Aditi to spy on him. Deciding Illiyasi has become expendable, Saurabh shoots him dead in the confrontation and escapes. Kabir gives chase to Saurabh and overpowers him. After an intense and bloody fight in a derelict church, the church's dome collapses on Saurabh, crushing his face and killing him.
        
        <br>The intelligence agency honours Khalid posthumously for his sacrifice as he laid down his life in order to save his nation and team with Nafeesa receiving an award from the Prime Minister. Kabir, who is still believed by the agency to be a traitor, spends time with Ruhi and continues with his next undercover mission after a brief conversation with Sunil.
